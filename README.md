# Instruments
Python Instruments Library for common instruments in Spintronics at Nottingham

This repo includes examples scripts, WIP scripts and actually used scripts for convenience. 

Please excuse the informal format of the repo. There are plans to create appropriate branches and neaten things up in the future (probably when procrastinating).
